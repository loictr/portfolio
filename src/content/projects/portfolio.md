## Back and forth to Bolt.new

I bootstrapped this portfolio using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/). it suggested me to build an [Astro](https://astro.build/) site. After trying Jekyll, and its outdated usage on github pages, I gave it a try and kept it. It also created the deployment pipeline to host it as github pages. Then I manipulated the code manually and experimented the re-import to Bolt.new. It has been a good experiment of how to use this tool in a low-code approach.
