### Presentation

Cocktails explorer is a website presenting cocktails recipes with their ingredients. I exploited an open database for retrieving the recipes. And, I used pandas to normalize the data. Finally, I vectorized the data by selecting the ingredients of the recipes.

The user selects one or more cocktails. And the recommendation system uses the vectorized ingredients data to suggest other cocktails to the user based on the distance between his selection and the other cocktails.

I bootstrapped the front using bolt.new
